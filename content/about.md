## Intro
I'm a data engineer based in Europe.

I build data platforms and products that continue to run and scale even after I stop actively working on them.

### Hotjar
#### Senior Data Engineer 2022—

I learnt how to do proper, hands-on data engineering at Hotjar (now part of Contentsquare). Finally, I was building the data infrastructure instead of just using it.

I learnt too many technologies to list, but I especially enjoyed working with Terraform, the Kafka ecosystem, dbt, and serverless AWS services. I also learnt some Java, which gave me a completely different perspective compared to Python.

After the acquisition by Contentsquare, I was happy to switch to Snowflake and Dagster, which I had long wanted to use.

### Meta
#### Lead Data Engineer (2020-2022)

My time at Facebook turned me into a huge fan of big data technologies, working with Spark, Presto, and the predecessor of Airflow.

Besides Python, I could finally work with a new language: ~PHP~ [Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programming_language)). 

Helping build products that impact billions of people was a life-changing experience. Working on child safety projects was probably the most rewarding area I can imagine as an engineer.

### Skyscanner
#### Analytics Lead (2018-2020)

My data career started here when the company introduced Databricks but didn’t have any data engineers.

Before that, I focused on AWS optimisation, and suddenly I was writing loads of SQL and Python (and never stopped).

Later, a very kind senior engineer gave me the chance to contribute to the revenue forecasting service, which was an amazing learning opportunity.
